## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document, created for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research", in completion of "Peer Assessment 1".

### Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")
}
initialdata <- read.csv("activity.csv")

#remove NA values
data <- initialdata[!(is.na(initialdata$steps)), ]
```

### Calculate steps per day and Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
totalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)

hist(totalStepsDay$steps, xlab="Number of Steps Taken",
     breaks = 10,
     main="Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken per Day")
```



### Mean and median number of steps taken each day
```{r}
meanStep <- mean(totalStepsDay$steps)
medianStep <- median(totalStepsDay$steps)
```
Mean of step taken is `r meanStep` and median is `r medianStep`

### Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

```{r}
meanStepsInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

plot(x=meanStepsInterval$interval, y=meanStepsInterval$steps,
     type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval",
     ylab="Number of Steps", xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)")
```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
maxStep <- max(meanStepsInterval$steps)
maxindex<- grep(max(meanStepsInterval$steps),
                meanStepsInterval$steps)
maxInterval <- meanStepsInterval[maxindex,]
maxInterval
```
So the interval `r maxInterval$interval` has maximum mean steps with value `r maxStep`

###  Imputing missing values
creating new data set replacing NA values with mean steps of that interval
```{r}
newdata <- initialdata
for (i in 1:nrow(initialdata)) {
  if(is.na(newdata[i,1])==TRUE){
    newdata[i,1]<- meanStepsInterval[i,2]
  }
}

```

Calculate steps per day and Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after removing NA values
```{r}
newtotalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, newdata, sum)

hist(newtotalStepsDay$steps, xlab="Number of Steps Taken",
     breaks = 10,
     main="Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken per Day")
```

### Mean and median number of steps taken each day after imputing
```{r}
newmeanStep <- mean(newtotalStepsDay$steps)
newmedianStep <- median(newtotalStepsDay$steps)
```
Mean of step taken after imputing is `r newmeanStep` and median is `r newmedianStep`, earlier it was `r meanStep` and `r medianStep` respectively

### To check differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends

dividing data into weekday and weekends
```{r}
daysData <- newdata
daysData$daytype <- as.character(rep(0, times=nrow(daysData)))

for (i in 1:nrow(daysData)) {
  if((weekdays( as.Date(daysData[i,2])) == "Saturday")|
     (weekdays( as.Date(daysData[i,2])) == "Sunday")){
    daysData[i,4]<-"weekend"
  }else{
    daysData[i,4]<-"weekday"
  }
}
#daysData$day <- weekdays( as.Date(daysData$date))
daysData$daytype <- factor(daysData$daytype)

```

COmparing weekdays and weekend data
```{r}
weekdayData <- daysData[daysData$daytype=="weekday", ]
weekendData <- daysData[daysData$daytype=="weekend", ]
```

Next, the average number of steps per interval is calculated.

```{r}
weekdayMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, weekdayData, mean)
weekendMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, weekendData, mean)
```

Now the panel plot is created. The x axis indicates each 5 minute interval, and the y axis shows the average number of steps taken. The two plots are divided into weekday, and weekend data.
```{r}

plot(weekdayMean$interval, weekdayMean$steps, type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval, for Weekdays",
     xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)", ylab="Number of Steps")
plot(weekendMean$interval, weekendMean$steps, type="l",
     main="Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken per Interval, for Weekends",
     xlab="Intervals (in 5 mins)", ylab="Number of Steps")
```

From the plot difference between weekend and weekday can be seen
